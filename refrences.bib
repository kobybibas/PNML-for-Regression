abstract = {This paper consists of an overview on universal prediction from an$\backslash$ninformation-theoretic perspective. Special attention is given to the$\backslash$nnotion of probability assignment under the self-information loss$\backslash$nfunction, which is directly related to the theory of universal data$\backslash$ncompression. Both the probabilistic setting and the deterministic$\backslash$nsetting of the universal prediction problem are described with emphasis$\backslash$non the analogy and the differences between results in the two settings$\backslash$n},
